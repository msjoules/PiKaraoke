#### YouTube In App Direct

This particular branch is focused on allowing YouTube to be watched without downloading.  I've embedded the videos in a separate html page.
What this means is you don't see this on the splash screen on your TV; instead, you can watch this on your app.  

Furthermore, the problems with embedding YouTube videos are 1) DRM restrictions and 2) creator content restrictions.  This will cause 
most of the karaoke videos to fail loading.

So why bother when you can just watch it in your browser?  Good question which is why I will not merge this into the master branch.
